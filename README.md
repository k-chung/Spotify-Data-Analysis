# Spotify-Data-Analysis

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/solomonameh/spotify-music-dataset?resource=download

The dataset is collated from Spotify's API using two separate python scripts to extract popular and non-popular songs and their associated audio and descriptive features. Descriptive features of a song include information about the song such as the artist name, album name and release date. Audio features include key, valence , danceability and energy which are results of spotify's audio analysis.

For this project, we will focus on the popular songs only.

I was motivated to use this dataset because I love curating playlists on Spotify based on how "similar" they sound, but haven't yet investigated the underlying factors for why they sound "similar". Also, the Kaggle usability score is 9.41, which is high.

I'm trying to answer: what are the top genres? Is there an association between a song's energy and danceability? Do songs get louder as the years go by?
